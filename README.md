Hello guys, thanks for taking the time of consider my application, I really would like working with you.

To solve the proposed problem, I made through an MVVM pattern using RxSwift to wrap the data and ui, to navitage through views I use a Coordinator pattern and to mapping data into model I choosed a Codable approache.

-Data level contains the abstraction to networking 
-App level contains all apps initialization 
-Scene level you can find the apps views
